The Center of Excellence approach
========================================================
<small>
Centralization is helpful and in certain cases absolutely necessary for generating business value with analytics. The Analytics Value Chain, needs **_ownership_** and **_alignments_** across functions. The centralized analytics team provides the Center of Excellence necessary to initiate, control, track, and close analytics processes and projects. This strong statement does not preclude the addition of other analytics team structures as an ancillary component, such as hub and spoke, federated, matrixed, and so on. For it is true that the larger the company, the more likely inevitable that data and analysis will be created outside of the centralized analytics team because it is unlikely a centralized team exists, or if it does, is funded or resourced adequately. The result of lack of centralization is **_data proliferation_**. </small>

What is data proliferation  
========================================================
<small>
Actually, data proliferation is the antithesis of centralization and can lead to inordinate issues creating analytical standards and adoption across a globally distributed organization. Thus, analytical centralization in and of itself creates business value. Consider the benefits of using a centralized team with three subteams:
* **Architecture and collection** subteam responsible for data collection, validation, governance, and systems configuration and administration. This subteam can be responsible for liaising with technical teams to support roadmap, ad-hoc, urgent, or process-based initiatives where deeper technical expertise is necessary than would be expected from a digital analyst who only worked with the business.  
* **Reporting** subteam in charge of all self-service and ad-hoc its beginnings in the business to its evolution in technology to its communication, judgment, and perception in the business. 
* **Analysis** subteam accountable for the creation, communication, and follow-up of analytics projects and deliverables.</small>

An Example
========================================================
<small>
Here's an example of how the teams could work together across the phased process to execute analytics : 

A business question is prioritized to be answered after being submitted via the standard Analytics Work Request Process. Within the specified period of time, the assigned point person on the analytics team responsible for assessing and managing the queue of analytics requests works with the team, as necessary, to prioritize the work by determining :  

A. Whether the work is justified and feasible. *Saying No is acceptable in context and with a reason.*  
B. Data exists and can be self-serviced.  
C. Data exists and must be prepared for reporting by the reporting subteam.  
D. Data exists and must be presented in person by the analytics subteam.  
E. Data does not exist.
</small>
  
========================================================

In Cases A to D, it is the responsibility of the analytics team to do what is necessary to execute the request and manage expectations as long as the data requested can be and should be delivered to the person requesting analytics work.

Case E, where the data does not exist, presents an opportunity for a decision:  
- Saying **No** for the long term with a business justification.  
- Saying **Yes**:  
    + The requestor must work within the roadmap and standard life-cycle processes to assist the analyst with prioritization and working with other teams as necessary. 
    + The architecture subteam takes the lead and works with the technology teams in the backend to the data while also working with the data governance team to ensure the data is defined and standardized. 

Deliver the analytics work request and close it in the work tracking system. 
<small>*Note to analyst* : note to whom, why, and who delivered the work and assignment of analytics value (=>prove the return-on-investment [ROI] of analytics). 
</small>
Conclusion
========================================================
<small>In the abstracted scenario, each of the three subteam verticals (architecture, reporting, and analysis) have responsibilities at various points in the process :

* A member of any of the three teams reviews, assesses, and assigns the work with help, as necessary, from other teams. 
* The reporting subteam prepares the necessary reports from already existing data.
* The analytics subteam analyzes existing reports and data, and then prepares and presents analysis. 
* The architecture subteam works with IT teams and other technical teams (such as development and quality assurance [QA]) to collect data and configure and prepare the analytics systems for use by teams that have access.

By applying this process within the Analytics Value Chain, you can see in the example the entire team works together with each other, supporting teams, and external stakeholders.</small>
